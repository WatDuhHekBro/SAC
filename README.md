# SAC
My goal for this is to merge all the calculators into one page where you don't have to go to other pages to calculate stuff like ratios and factors, also time eventually. For more complex stuff like calculating derivatives and graphs, I'll include links to some high-quality calculators.

# TODO
- Fix/improve infix parser
- Tidy up evalFunction and allow for recursion
- Check start/end validity to avoid infinite loops
- Add technical document
- Clean up the code and add blue comments detailing params and returns
- Modularize converters (0 is the base SI unit)
- Add support for multi-character tokens such as pi or trig functions
